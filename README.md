# Zenburn for OS X Terminal

This is an adaptation of Jani Nurminen’s [Zenburn] color scheme for the Terminal application built into OS X.

## Installation

1. Download and decompress the [zipball] if you haven’t already.
2. In the Terminal app, choose “Preferences…” from the “Terminal” menu.
3. Switch to the “Profiles” tab.
4. Click the gear icon below the list of profiles and select “Import…”.
5. Choose the “Zenburn.terminal” file from the archive you decompressed.

### Caveat

Each “terminal profile” includes not just color settings but also a bevy of other settings—font, window position, window title, etc. To minimize this annoyance I started with the “Basic” profile and changed just the colors in order to make Zenburn.terminal. You may still wish to change the other options to suit your preferences.

### Compatibility

This terminal profile works under OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) and 10.10 (Yosemite). I don’t know whether it will work on earlier versions.
